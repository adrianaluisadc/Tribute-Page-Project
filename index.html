            He had seen the best and the worst, yet he still faces the odd with
            bravery and courage. I could not ask for more of a man who is not
            frightened to face the greatest fears in the name of life. The one
            who isn't afraid to move forward and continue on growing.

          <h2>The Strong</h2>
          <p>
            A thousand storms may try to bring him to shatter, but he remains
            still and keeps on fighting. Nothing can bring him down because he
            can always stand up for he is strong and willed to fight.

          <h2>The Clever</h2>
          <p>
            Life may throw him obstacles and rocks on the way, but he knows the
            other route. His strategies and tactics has made different positive
            outcomes from what seems to be the impossible. With his mind, no
            challenges seem to be big to overcome.

          <div id="content-paragraphs">
            <p id="content-text-p">
              A <em>fighter</em>. That's how I would describe <b>My Ananta</b>.
              People surrounding him doesn't have any idea how many battles he
              has to face alone and still win. This shows how resilient he is in
              any circumstances life may play. His heart is pure and soft, but
              very strong and unbreakable. Personally, I feel safe because of
              these characteristic he posseseses. I am not afraid to face
              anything because I have him always on my side.
            </p>
            <p id="content-text-p2">
              Moreover, he has a very optimistic spirit no matter the
              happenings are. He looks at the silver linings. This lifts up the
              people surrounding him. With the philosophical mindset towards the
              world, he has an unorthodox ideologies. He appreciates unique
              people and knows their capabilities and strengths, and help them
              discover it. People around him are lucky, for they have someone to
              look up to that would help them get up.
            </p>

            <p id="content-text-p3">
              He is a motivated self-taught learner and it makes him grow at his
              own pace and faster than average people could catch up. I really
              love the fact how he values learning and knowledge. I could never
              forget what he once told me. . .that there is no such thing as a
              person who can't learn because our brain are so much adaptable to
              learning. Intelligence is not a fixed thing, it can change over
              time with hard work and motivation to learn.
            </p>

            <p id="content-text-p4">
              And last but not the least, his passion towards music touches my
              heart. Every time Maya gives me serenades, it gives me chills. For
              he sings from the heart and play different instruments, I could
              feel the music he is playing. It speaks its own language. There is
              no such day as no melody, for he makes my life filled with life,
              music and growth.
